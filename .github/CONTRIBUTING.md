## Getting Started

1. [Fork](https://github.com/usemarble/marble/fork/) this repository to your own account

   - Visit Marble repository

   - Click the "Fork" button in the top right

   - [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the fork to your local device.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/marble.git
   cd marble
   ```

   - add the original repo as upstream

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/usemarble/marble.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies

    ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Configure Environment Variables

   Each app/package that uses environment variables has an example env file. You’ll need to copy and fill those out:

   ```bash
   cp apps/api/.dev.vars.example apps/api/.dev.vars
   cp apps/cms/.env.example apps/cms/.env
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   cp packages/drizzle/.env.example packages/drizzle/.env
   ```

   You'll need:

   - A Postgres connection string (either neon or use docker to self host)

   - Redis credentials from Upstash (see below)

   - Google and GitHub OAuth credentials (how to get these)

   - A BetterAuth secret

   - Cloudflare R2 credentials for file uploads (see below)

   - Optional: If you want to test payments, set up a [Polar](https://sandbox.polar.sh) sandbox account and fill in the POLAR_* variables.

4. Database Setup

   ### Option 1: Use Neon (Hosted)

   We use Neon for the database. Create a Neon project and copy your connection string for Drizzle
   (ensure it includes `sslmode=require`).

   - Paste it into the relevant env files:
   Example:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>/<db>?sslmode=require"
   ```

   - Paste it into the relevant env files:
   - `apps/api/.dev.vars` → `DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_STRING_HERE>`
   - `apps/cms/.env` → `DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_STRING_HERE>`
   - `packages/drizzle/.env` → `DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_STRING_HERE>`

   - Run migrations:

      ```bash
      pnpm db:migrate
      ```

   ### Option 2: Use Docker (Local)

   Prerequisites: Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine + Docker Compose v2 (Linux).

   Start a local Postgres and run migrations:

   ```bash
   # from repo root
   pnpm docker:up
   # wait for the DB to be healthy (one of):
   #   pnpm docker:logs    # watch for "database system is ready to accept connections"
   #   docker compose ps   # ensure STATUS is "healthy"
   ## Alternatively, if your Docker Compose version supports it:
   # docker compose up -d --wait
   pnpm db:migrate
   ```

   If you’re using the local Docker DB, set `DATABASE_URL` in these env files:
   - `apps/api/.dev.vars`
   - `apps/cms/.env`
   - `packages/drizzle/.env`

   Example:
   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://usemarble:justusemarble@localhost:5432/marble
   ```
   Note: These credentials are for local development only. Do not use them in production.

This will:

- Build (if needed) and start the Postgres container defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Expose Postgres on port `5432` using the credentials from the compose file.
- Persist data in the `marble_pgdata` Docker volume.
- Note: If you already have a local Postgres on port 5432, stop it or adjust the port mapping in `docker-compose.yml`.

   Useful commands:

   ```bash
   pnpm docker:logs    # follow DB logs
   pnpm docker:down    # stop containers
   pnpm docker:clean   # stop and remove volumes (DESTROYS local data)
   ```

### Google OAuth

   Create a project in the Google Cloud Console.
   Follow [the first step](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/google) in the Better Auth documentation to set up Google OAuth and set the values for `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### GitHub OAuth

   If you would rather use github you can follow [the first step](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/authentication/github#get-your-github-credentials) in the better auth docs to setup Github oAuth and set the environment values for `GITHUB_ID` and `GITHUB_SECRET`

### Set up Cloudflare R2 for media uploads

   To use media uploads in Marble, you’ll need to set up a Cloudflare R2 bucket. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you configure everything properly:

- Go to your Cloudflare dashboard

- Select your account and navigate to R2 from the sidebar

- Click "Create Bucket"

- Name your bucket (e.g. marble-media)

- Hit 'Create"

- switch to the settings tab and enable "public development url"

- copy the value to `CLOUDFLARE_PUBLIC_URL`

- Set your bucket name to `CLOUDFLARE_BUCKET_NAME`

- Go back to your R2 buckets overview and click "API"

- from the dropdown select "Use r2 with apis"

- then copy the api url and set to `CLOUDFLARE_S3_ENDPOINT`

- Below the url click "Create api Tokens"

- Select "Create user API Token"

- For permissions select "admin read and write"

- Leave everything else as default and click "Create user API Token"

- Copy the values to `CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY_ID` respectively

## Set up Redis

### Option 1: Use Upstash Redis

   Marble uses Redis for rate limiting, session caching, and analytics. We use [Upstash](https://upstash.com) for serverless Redis. Here's how to set it up:

- Go to [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com) and sign in or create an account

- Click "Create Database"

- Give your database a name (e.g. marble-redis)

- Select a region close to your primary deployment region

- Leave the type as "Regional" (free tier)

- Click "Create"

- Once created, scroll down to the "REST API" section

- Copy the "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL" value and set it to `REDIS_URL` in your environment files

- Copy the "UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN" value and set it to `REDIS_TOKEN` in your environment files

   You'll need to add these to:
   - `apps/api/.dev.vars` → `REDIS_URL=<YOUR_URL_HERE>` and `REDIS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>`
   - `apps/cms/.env` → `REDIS_URL=<YOUR_URL_HERE>` and `REDIS_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>`

### Option 2: Docker (Local)

Use the repository's Docker Compose services to run Redis locally (native Redis + Upstash-compatible HTTP bridge):

```bash
# from repo root
pnpm docker:up
pnpm docker:ps
```

Expected Redis services:
- `redis` on `localhost:6379`
- `serverless-redis-http` on `localhost:8079`

Set these in your env files:
- `apps/api/.dev.vars` → `REDIS_URL=http://localhost:8079` and `REDIS_TOKEN=justusemarble`
- `apps/cms/.env` → `REDIS_URL=http://localhost:8079` and `REDIS_TOKEN=justusemarble`

These values match the local defaults in:
- `apps/api/.dev.vars.example`
- `apps/cms/.env.example`
- `docker-compose.yml` (`SRH_TOKEN=justusemarble`, `8079:80`, `6379:6379`)

Stop services when done:

```bash
pnpm docker:down
```

## Running the Apps

From the root you can run all apps

```bash
pnpm dev
```

or just one

```bash
pnpm cms:dev
pnpm api:dev
pnpm web:dev
pnpm docs:dev
```

## Contributing to docs

The documentation lives in `apps/docs` and is built with [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). To contribute:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20.17.0+ (same as the main project)
- No database, Redis, or OAuth setup required

### Option A: From the monorepo root (recommended)

After `pnpm install`, run:

```bash
pnpm docs:dev
```

This uses the Mintlify CLI from the workspace—no global install needed. Docs preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Option B: Manual setup

If you prefer the CLI globally:

```bash
pnpm add -g mint
cd apps/docs
mint dev
```

### Port conflicts

If port 3000 is in use (e.g. by another app), use a different port:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

### Useful commands

From `apps/docs`:

- `mint broken-links` — Find broken internal links
- `mint a11y` — Check accessibility (contrast, alt text)
- `mint validate` — Validate the build (useful for CI)

### Project structure

See [apps/docs/README.md](../apps/docs/README.md) for the docs file layout.

## Agent skills (optional)

The repo root has a [`skills-lock.json`](../skills-lock.json) file that pins [Agent Skills](https://skills.sh/) (for example Cloudflare, Tiptap, Vercel labs, and Resend-related packages). Installed skill files live under gitignored paths (for example `.agents/skills/`, `.cursor/skills/`, and `.claude/skills/`) so they are not committed.

After cloning, you can restore the same skills from the lockfile from the repository root:

```bash
npx skills experimental_install
```

`experimental_install` is the current CLI command that reads `skills-lock.json`. Adding a package updates the lockfile — for example:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/cloudflare/skills
npx skills add ueberdosis/tiptap
npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills
npx skills add resend/email-best-practices
```

If you add or change skills for the team, commit the updated `skills-lock.json`.

## Making changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. Before committing your changes make sure to run the lint and format commands (via ultracite/Biome) to catch any issues

   ```bash
   pnpm format
   ```

   or if you would rather fix issues yourself, run the following to list problems without fixing

   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

3. Test your changes and make sure they work and run a build

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. If your build succeeds you can go ahead and make a commit using conventional [commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

```bash
git commit -m "fix(cms): fix sidebar overflow issue"
```

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Your PR should reference an issue (if applicable) or clearly describe its impact on the project. [see how to Link a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
- Include a clear description of the changes
- Keep PRs small and focused. Large PRs are harder to review and may be rejected or delayed.
- Ensure consistency with the existing codebase. Use ultracite (Biome) for linting and formatting.
- Include tests if applicable
- Update documentation if your changes affect usage or API behavior.

## Code Style

- Follow the existing code formatting in the project (use ultracite/Biome for consistency).
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Reporting Issues

- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Check if the issue already exists before creating a new one
- Provide a clear description of the issue
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
